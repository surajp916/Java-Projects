/**
 * Steps to implement this class main method:
 * 
 * Step 1:
 * DimensionInputFile name is passed through the command line as args[0]
 * Read from the DimensionsInputFile with the format:
 * 1. The first line with three numbers:
 *      i.    a (int): number of dimensions in the graph
 *      ii.   b (int): the initial size of the cluster table prior to rehashing
 *      iii.  c (double): the capacity(threshold) used to rehash the cluster table 
 * 2. a lines, each with:
 *      i.    The dimension number (int)
 *      ii.   The number of canon events for the dimension (int)
 *      iii.  The dimension weight (int)
 * 
 * Step 2:
 * SpiderverseInputFile name is passed through the command line as args[1]
 * Read from the SpiderverseInputFile with the format:
 * 1. d (int): number of people in the file
 * 2. d lines, each with:
 *      i.    The dimension they are currently at (int)
 *      ii.   The name of the person (String)
 *      iii.  The dimensional signature of the person (int)
 * 
 * Step 3:
 * SpotInputFile name is passed through the command line as args[2]
 * Read from the SpotInputFile with the format:
 * Two integers (line seperated)
 *      i.    Line one: The starting dimension of Spot (int)
 *      ii.   Line two: The dimension Spot wants to go to (int)
 * 
 * Step 4:
 * TrackSpotOutputFile name is passed in through the command line as args[3]
 * Output to TrackSpotOutputFile with the format:
 * 1. One line, listing the dimenstional number of each dimension Spot has visited (space separated)
